            Wretched Origins:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Legend has it that in a mystical kitchen of chaos, a mischievous chef sought to create 
            the ultimate cursed culinary creation. Driven by madness and a twisted sense of taste, 
            they decided to merge two incompatible worlds: pizza and bananas. The result? 
            The infamous Banana Pizza Delight, a dish that defies all culinary norms and leaves a 
            trail of puzzled taste buds in its wake.
        </p>

                <h3>Prepare for the Cursed Concoction:</h3>
                <p>Gather all the ingredients, don your chef's hat, and mentally prepare yourself for 
                    the wild journey ahead.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Sauce of Mystery:</h3>
                <p>Spread the tomato sauce onto the pre-made pizza crust, or your homemade creation 
                    if you dare to venture into unknown culinary realms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cheesy Darkness:</h3>
                <p>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Allow the cheese to embrace the tomato sauce, creating a fusion of flavors that will confuse your taste buds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Bananas Enter:</h3>
                <p>Carefully place the thinly sliced bananas on top of the cheese. Yes, you read that right – bananas on pizza. Embrace the chaos, for it is the essence of this cursed creation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Summon the Bacon (Optional):</h3>
                <p>For an extra twist of madness, layer cooked bacon slices over the bananas. This fusion of sweet and savory will leave your friends and family questioning your sanity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fiery Finale (Optional):</h3>
                <p>If you dare to add a touch of spiciness, sprinkle some red chili flakes on top. Watch as the flames of curiosity dance on the taste buds of those brave enough to take a bite.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Bake the Madness:</h3>
                <p>Follow the baking instructions on your pre-made pizza crust, or if you're using your own creation, bake at 400°F (200°C) until the cheese melts and the crust becomes golden brown. This cursed concoction needs time to reach its peak of oddity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Cursed Feast Begins:</h3>
                <p>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a moment. Slice it into pieces and gather your unsuspecting victims around the table. Serve the Banana Pizza Delight with a wicked smile and watch as their expressions go from curiosity to pure bewilderment.</p>
            </li>
